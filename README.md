**Speaker2: An AI-Powered Speech-to-Text and Audio Analysis Tool**

## üìã What's Included
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Utilize the power of transformers and assemblyai to convert audio files to text.
- **Audio Analysis**: Leverage torchaudio and numpy for audio processing and analysis.
- **Video Processing**: Use pytube to extract audio from videos and pydub for audio manipulation.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Employ gtts to convert text back to speech.
- **Model Integration**: Integrate with Whisper for state-of-the-art speech recognition models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
```bash
pip install torchaudio numpy pytube groq gtts transformers torch assemblyai pydub whisper
```

## üìä Usage
To use Speaker2, simply import the necessary modules and use the provided functions to perform speech-to-text conversion, audio analysis, or text-to-speech synthesis. For example:
```python
from speaker2 import speech_to_text, audio_analysis, text_to_speech

# Load an audio file
audio = torchaudio.load('audio_file.wav')

# Perform speech-to-text conversion
text = speech_to_text(audio)

# Analyze the audio file
analysis = audio_analysis(audio)

# Convert text back to speech
speech = text_to_speech(text)
```

## üîß Technologies
